This module for the [Pathfinder 1e game system](https://gitlab.com/Furyspark/foundryvtt-pathfinder1) for [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](http://foundryvtt.com/) provides additional functionality and support for the rule set [Final Fantasy d20](https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/).

As the module is still heavily in development, the best source for available features and notable changes is its [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

## Installation

To install the module navigate to Foundry's _Add-on Modules_ tab in the Setup menu and paste the following link in the **Install Module** dialog:

[https://github.com/Ritsuna/foundryvtt-pf1-ffd20/-/releases/permalink/latest/downloads/module.json](https://github.com/Ritsuna/foundryvtt-pf1-ffd20/-/releases/permalink/latest/downloads/module.json)

The module can also be installed manually by downloading a zip archive from the Releases Page and extracting it to Foundry's `Data/modules/pf1ffd20` directory.

## Development

### Prerequisites

In order to build this module, recent versions of `node` and `npm` are required.
Most likely using `yarn` also works but only `npm` is officially supported.
If you use `nvm` to manage your `node` versions, you can simply run

```bash
nvm install
```

in the project's root directory.

You also need to install the project's dependencies. To do so, run

```bash
npm ci
```

### Building

You can build the project by running

```bash
npm run build
```

Alternatively, you can run

```bash
npm run build:watch
```

to watch for changes and automatically build as necessary.

### Linking the built project to Foundry VTT

In order to provide a fluent development experience, it is recommended to link
the built module to your local Foundry VTT installation's data folder. In
order to do so, first add a file called `foundryconfig.json` to the project root
with the following content:

```json
{
  "dataPath": "/absolute/path/to/your/FoundryVTT/Data"
}
```

(if you are using Windows, make sure to use `\` as a path separator instead of `/`)

Then run

```bash
npm run link-package
```

On Windows, creating symlinks requires administrator privileges so unfortunately
you need to run the above command in an administrator terminal for it to work.

### Running the tests

You can run the tests with the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

A manual type checking process can be started by running

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
After having built the module as least once as per [building](#Building), you can start a development server by running

```bash
npm run serve
```

This development server runs on port `30001`, and is able to hot reload CSS and Handlebars template changes, as well as offering some reload functionality for TS code changes.
